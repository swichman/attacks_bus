# ATTACKS(ATX)-Bus
This is a board designed to power eurorack applications using an ATX power supply from a PC. I tend to have them laying around, so this seemed a logical use. The bus bar presents 7 devices with power, and the bus bar connects to other bus bars to extent the power to new racks or for more ports in the same rack.

This project was created using kicad, and the project files are included. If that's more involved than you would like to be, also included is a zip file of all of the required files to drop off at the board manufacturer of your choice, and BOM, so that you can order all of the parts you need to build your own.
